# Development of a model based on adaptative neuronal networks to optimise the performance of the new generation in combustion engines.

This repository comes from a bachelor's final project in UPV, Valencia, Spain. 

In this work, a model based on adaptative supervised neuronal networks is proposed to identify and predict the behaviour of different parameters on a reciprocating engine, developing and training the neuronal network and validating the model through MATLAB.

The proposed algorithm can be executed in real-time and allows the system to adapt, predicting the engine's behaviour, even if there are failures, ageing or manufacturing dispersion.
